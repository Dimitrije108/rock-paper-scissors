# rock-paper-scissors

This is a 5 round game of rock, paper, scissors played vs computer, built as a part of The Odin Project.

This is my first JavaScript project. I applied basic JS concepts such as variables, functions, string methods, conditional statements, loops and others. I learned the value of using a chrome debugger and approached the problem with planning and problem solving in mind.
